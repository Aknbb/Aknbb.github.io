<h1>Bungee Jumping</h1>
<h2>The most excited experience ever!</h2>
<article>
<p>I had experienced Bungee Jumping in Krakow on my Erasmus times.Here is a quote about Bungee Jumping: </p>
<blockquote cite="https://global.britannica.com/sports/bungee-jumping">
Bungee jumping, sport in which the jumper falls from a high place with a rubber (“bungee”) cord attached both to his or her feet and to the jump site, and, after a period of headfirst free fall, is bounced partway back when the cord rebounds from its maximum stretch. It traces its roots to the “land diving” practiced on Pentecost Island, Vanuatu, in which divers jump off a high tower, their feet connected to it by a vine whose length is calculated to allow the jumper to fall until his hair just brushes the ground below.
